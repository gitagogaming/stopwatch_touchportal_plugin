# stopwatch_touchportal_plugin



A very simple stopwatch plugin.
Use it to calculate the time it takes to complete certain actions in Touchportal, and or potentially use it for creating some sort of react game inside of OBS.

States:
- Status: Started / Stopped
- Current Elapsed Time
- Total Elapsed Time
