# Stopwatch Touchportal Plugin

A very simple stopwatch plugin.<br>
Use it to calculate the time it takes to complete certain actions in Touchportal, and or potentially use it for creating some sort of react game inside of OBS.


**Actions:**
- Start Stopwatch and displayed decimal places
- Stop Stopwatch


**States:**
- Status: Started / Stopped
- Current Elapsed Time
- Total Elapsed Time


Any feature requests/ideas please open an issue or reach out to me in the TouchPortal Discord.
